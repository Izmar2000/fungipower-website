# FungiPower Branding Guidelines

## Core Colors
- **Scelta Orange (Gradient Start):** `#F58220`
- **Scelta Red (Gradient End):** `#D71920`
- **Champagne Platinum (Text Gradient):** `from-[#FFFFFF] via-[#FFF0E0] to-[#FFFFFF]`

## Usage Notes
The primary background for the Hero section and high-impact areas should use the linear gradient (135deg) from `#F58220` to `#D71920`.
This orange-to-red transition is based on the Scelta Mushrooms aesthetic and is the final approved brand color.

## Logo
- **Main Logo:** `public/images/FungiPower Logo.png` (or the SVG version in `public/Logo trans/`)
- **Cropping Rule:** When used in the header, the logo is often cropped to remove trailing elements for a more compact, centered look.
